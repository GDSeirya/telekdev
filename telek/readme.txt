Problems, please mail: "rubyprojectgoblin@hotmail.com" Any emails involving threats, pornography, or offensive material will be missed but any bug report, you will be listened to and will be added to the credit, do not report fake bugs. You do not expect another version release just because you found a bug, the creator has to make more updates than just simple updates like bug fixes unless the mod is at its end.

FAQ:

Q: Why'd you call this Telek?
A: Originally this mod was based on the film "Push" with every weapon being telekinesis but then it expanded on with other weapons such as Dragon Eye. I recall getting mad that I couldn't code in LUA back then so I was like check out what I can do. Now I can so, yeah.

Q: I'm your biggest fan, can I have your autograph?
A: No, don't even come to my house, my face causes gag reflexes. Wow, my ego must be really bad back then.

Q: What software did you use to edit the sounds?
A: Audacity.

Q: What program did you use to make the majority of the GFX?
A: GIMP

Q: Why some weapon names are ridiculous such as Pretty Princess Railgun? It's like calling the Bat mobile the Gay Car. Why not Omega Plasma Railgun X?
A: Don't be jealous because I name my weapons better than yours.

Q: How old is this mod?
A: It's created on June 18th 2009. Continued on February 15th 2015.

Q: Did you make this mod?
A: Yes, of course.

Q: Can I be on your team?
A: Maybe.

Q: Can I edit your mod?
A: NOT WITHOUT PERMISSION. However, you can edit but do not distribute your mod, I rather not have too many versions floating about with a chance of bad edits. I won't have control over this but that's my point of view. I mean I'm not going to smack you for releasing a slightly edited version.

Q: Can I upload this elsewhere?
A: Of course, but please keep the readme with the mod without any modifications, that would be nice.

Q: Boring mod.
A: Plenty of other mods to play, at least back then. Most of the uploads are dead.

Q: Can you script in LUA?
A: NO... sadly. I can now though.

Q: Do you take ideas for weapons? || Do you take weapon requests?
A: It depends on the weapon.

Q: Can I use your GFX and SFX?
A: Yes, though it'd be cool where you told me where you used it but eh.

Q: Can we make a collaboration mod.
A: I'm interested, but I will take little role.

Q: Can you make weapons for me?
A: No.

Q: How do I mod like you?
A: Experiment with a copy of defualt and see the changes, don't rush yourself

Q: Could you make a logo for me?
A: I'm sorry but I'm too busy.

Q: It takes forever to load the mod!
A: Give it time, it's a large mod. I noticed it was part of OLX's mod pack, and geez. I just wondered to myself should I be ashamed that it's so large?

Q: It's not balanced is it?
A: No, not really. Though, I suppose it could be seen as a tech demo mod.

Q: Does it work online?
A: It pretty much does, though default gusanos sync accuracy, but that's not too bad.

Q: IT LAGS SOO BAD!
A: Try cutting down the amount of bots and be sure that you meet the minimum requirements of:
2.80 GHz
3.50 GB of RAM
And preferrably Duo Core CPU

Q: Can I use some sounds and graphics?
A: Yes, you're free to use Telek as a modding resourc, I'd like to know where you used it for fun~

Q: Why is there so many dragon references?
A: ... Um. I got a thing for dragons.

Q: Did you do this without using LUA?
A: Yes... Well, not really. I had to use Lua to hide the names and health. That was it. Well.. until recently, I learnt to program.

Q: What is that song played when I use SilverDragon[M] The Arbiter?
A: Ellywu2, pixietricks - Schala and the Queen

Q: What's with the weapons in the weapons folder with .awpn as its extension?
A: They're incomplete weapons or removed from the mod, most do nothing interesting.
Feel free to set its extension to .wpn.

Q: Lovely Despise won't fire!
A: Hold fire and you'll begin shooting barrage of energy balls.

Q: Some weapons lag so much on explosion or detonation!
A: If those weapons are Cthul Primary Cannon & Dragon's Eye, then it would only lag once and won't lag again on the second fire.

Q: Did you make this?
A: ..........FOR THE LAST TIME, YES!

~ NEW SET OF QUESTIONS

Q: You must have been a brat back then.
A: Please don't remind me...

Q: Why are you continuing this mod?
A: For fun, I know nobody plays it anymore but I'd like to do so.

Q: You're a poopy head.
A: Ok.

Q: What do you think of pepsi?
A: Pessi is so spicy.

Q: How old..?
A: I was around 14 years old. 6 years later, I came back to mod.

Q: Future of this mod?
A: I wanna try a lot of things since I learnt LUA. Maybe a survival mode versus zombies? Maybe expanding more on the lore for fun? I suppose you could say this is becoming an RPing mod. It tries to be balanced but it's not.

Q: What's the kanji in the background read as?
A: Nen-riki (念力) For Telekinetic powers

Q: I googled Nekriki, it says "Will Power"
A: I guess so.

Footnotes: I was a doofus back then. I'm so sorry. Thanks for understanding, I was like 13 back then. Haha.
