Mario, the classical level by Johan Otterud is back, this time for Gusanos!

This version of Mario is very different from the previous Liero and LOSP versions. The Liero version was from the time that Powerlevels were not invented yet. As a result, the level was colored brown and grey, with a bit of red and yellow-ish.
The LOSP version was done in the colors of the original Mario games (from the NES), but was an almost exact replica of the Liero level.
The Gusanos version however uses the SNES graphics from "Super Mario Allstars". This gives the level a whole new feel. Gusanos offers the use of animated sprites, so they were added to make it feel even more like the original games.
However, the clouds from Mario 2 are not animated because I felt it looked wrong. I also left in the original clouds because the "new" SNES clouds are a lot bigger.
The background is from Mario 1/2, as the Mario 3 background looked too crowded.
